Avoid carpooling, food sharing and gathering in confined places.

K\u00fcnstler*innen, Musiker*innen, Kreative arbeiten oft jahrelang an sich und ihrem Projekt. Ein wesentlicher Punkt ist dabei vor allem die Finanzierung. Gerade wenn es mit einer F\u00f6rderung nicht klappt oder der eigene Spartopf aufgebraucht ist, stellt das Crowdfunding eine wirkliche &amp; lohnende Alternative dar!</p> <p>ANNE ECK, Singer &amp; Songwriterin &amp; Labelchefin von Silvertree Records e.U. hat 2016 damals selbst den Entschluss gefasst Ihre erste EP RISE mithilfe einer Crowdfunding Kampagne zu realisieren \u2013 und das h\u00f6chst erfolgreich. Mit \u00fcber 100 Unterst\u00fctzer*innen, dem Bank Austria Kunst- und Kulturpreis und \u00fcber[masked]\u20ac konnte sie sich die gesamte Produktion realisieren.</p> <p>In diesem Workshop teilt Anne ihr Wissen und ihre Erfahrungen mit den Smart-User*innen \u2013 \u00fcbrigens auch die Fehler, denn daraus lernt man ja bekanntlich am meisten ;-): Was braucht es alles f\u00fcr eine Crowdfunding Kampagne, Tips &amp; Tricks, Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s \u2013 vor allem aber bringt sie Licht ins Dunkel, macht Mut, das ganz eigene Projekt zu verwirklichen und loszugehen f\u00fcr das, was da kreativ so herumschwirrt und raus will in einem!

While other practices may have a more physical or Asana (posture) focus, the challenge in Dru is to embrace the stillness and get comfortable with yourself! And indeed this can be the ultimate challenge! You may be physically very adept, but contacting your inner self in this way can be a new challenge and is a courageous path as when you take your attention inside and embrace the thoughts and emotions that we are often keen to run from or be distracted from.</p> <p>WEEKLY SCHEDULE &amp; HOW TO JOIN (VIA ZOOM)</p> <p>Join Zoom Meeting<br/><a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/485511752?pwd=eVNiaC9zdWxaU2RPc2I4d2JiV3Q3QT09\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/j/485511752?pwd=eVNiaC9zdWxaU2RPc2I4d2JiV3Q3QT09</a></p> <p>Meeting ID:[masked]<br/>Password: megarest</p> <p>If you feel the impulse, I am also open to receiving donations for offering these sessions, and they would be appreciated.<br/><a href=\"https://www.paypal.me/RichardBrook22\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.paypal.me/RichardBrook22</a></p> <p>This Week's Full Schedule (please note some of these are only listed via the Creative Wellness website or Facebook page - please see links at foot of listing)</p> <p>Tuesday 5 - 5.30pm - Reclaim Your Space<br/>Wednesday 5- 5.30pm - Reclaim Your Space<br/>Wednesday 6 - 7.30pm - Super Relaxing Yoga with Rich<br/>Thursday 5 - 5.30pm - NO CLASS THIS WEEK</p> <p>CHALLENGING TIMES</p> <p>Finally, these are challenging times, and we need practices which bring us back to our centre, back to the sense of security of our own heart and soul and help to transcend the current circumstances.

As Starhawk points out in her opening statement, \u201cWe are at the environmental crisis of our lifetime, perhaps of humanities lifetime\u201d, and it is the women who are taking leadership roles in regards to the issues they are facing in their communities, cities, towns and villages. This worldly documentary inspires the viewer to create change and empowers them to be a part of this amazing movement that is emerging all around the globe in response to climate change and environmental challenges. ARISE is becoming a movement, not just a film.</p> <p>Arise weaves together beautiful moving images to tell a story with many stories. The viewer is able to experience 13 different women\u2019s voices in 13 different places throughout the world with the help of Narrator Daryl Hannah, poetry by poets such as Alice Walker, music by well known artists like Michael Franti, Moby and many more.

Therefore, for members who live close to the restaurant and who FEEL SAFE AND COMFORTABLE doing so, we\u2019re encouraging them to drop by the restaurant in person to pick up their orders, following all social-distancing guidelines and precautions while doing so. Alex will be on site to help coordinate pick-ups and deliveries.</p> <p>For members who opt out of a meal on the day of the event, you may receive a $25 gift card for use at a later date. The gift card will be mailed to you.</p> <p>Please note this is not an open invitation.

We\u2019ll keep broadcasting to our Wolf Camp Facebook page as a back-up, but will end broadcasts to Chris\u2019 personal facebook page when YouTube subscriptions reach the 1,000 needed.</p> <p>Announcements &amp; Reminders:</p> <p>\u2013 If you have time on your hands and you feel you\u2019re not in a high risk group, see if your fire station, hospital, social service organization or other essential facility has a suggestion on how you can can get trained to support them. Staple businesses like grocery stores may even be hiring.</p> <p>\u2013 If you still have an income or extra money, see if or when your fire station, hospital or other essential facility would appreciate delivery of a take-out order for one of their meals \u2013 it\u2019s a great way to support small businesses too. Don\u2019t forget essential non-profits which also need to keep people employed, and your favorite performing artists and venues which have little chance for income at this time.</p> <p>\u2013 We believe that going outside is the healthiest way to maintain happiness while social distancing, where virus concentrations dissipate in the fresh air and can even get killed by extended exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. It\u2019s where the sun helps us produce Vitamin D, keeping us happy and well. Gardening, in particular, is a great way to stay healthy, and if things get sparse, one of the best ways to increase food security.</p>", "tags": ["outdoors", "family-friendly"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/6/1/highres_490138465.jpeg"}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/good-world/events/270047312/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/good-world/events/270047312/", "start_time": 1587488400.0, "end_time": 1587495600.0, "location": {"latitude": "", "longitude": ""}, "name": "Online Discussion Meeting", "organiser": "Basic Income and Beyond", "price": 0, "is_online": false, "summary": "", "description_html": "<p>Online meeting to discuss Basic Income (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income\" class=\"linkified\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income</a>) and whatever else attendees want to talk about.

Movement is both the medicine and the metaphor, reaching across all languages, cultures and age groups to transform suffering into art, art into awareness, and awareness into action. Wherever the 5Rhythms are practiced, a community is born to dance, to sweat, to change, to support, and to provide a safe space for each of us to shatter the ego\u2019s hold and awaken the juicy, unpredictable, fascinating, edge-walking, rock star part of ourselves that yearns to be free.</p> <p>The 5Rhythms\u00ae are also called a Wave. A Wave of energy and vitality that is different every time, because we are constantly changing. While the Rhythms are universal they move through us via our unique ways of experiencing and expressing ourselves. It's a simple practice, and yet its effects can be powerful and profound.</p> <p>The rhythms are made up of:<br/>Flowing - calls us through our body, to honour the feminine and arrive in this home called body.<br/>Staccato - calls us through our heart to honour the masculine and the beat of life.<br/>Chaos - calls us through our big mind to let our small mind rest, to let go of what doesn't matter.<br/>Lyrical - calls us through our imagination and helps us lighten up.<br/>Stillness - calls us to compassion.</p> <p>Sometimes the teacher might lead one Wave in a class, sometimes two or three. Sometimes the Waves are really obvious, sometimes more subtle. As you practice they will start to become a part of your own map of aliveness and you may notice them not just in the dance but in every area of your life. It's a wild and wonderful ride, and beginners are welcome!</p>", "tags": ["sporty", "romantic"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/a/8/highres_478434184.jpeg"}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/Salsafreaks/events/270074027/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/Salsafreaks/events/270074027/", "start_time": 1587513600.0, "end_time": 1587520800.0, "location": {"latitude": 32.850033, "longitude": -97.14492}, "name": "Class is canceled until further notice", "organiser": "MY SALSA!!", "price": 10.0, "is_online": false, "summary": "", "description_html": "<p>Join us Every Tuesday Night!</p> <p>7 pm Intermediate Salsa<br/>8pm Intermediate Bachata</p> <p>$10 each class</p> <p>meet new people and enjoy learning and dancing..</p> <p>No partner needed, but if you have one BRING\"EM!</p> <p>We have large classes, no need to rsvp just come have fun!</p> <p>See you soon!</p> <p>Call Kane for more info!</p> <p>[masked]</p> <p>My Salsa Dance Company (Inside of Bedford Boys Ranch)</p> <p>2801 Forest Ridge Dr.<br/>Bedford, Tx 76021</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/9/d/600_466412925.jpeg\" /></p> <p>For more info on classes or memberships visit www.mysalsadancestudio.com</p>", "tags": ["sporty", "romantic"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/d/9/highres_489524761.jpeg"}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Scottish-Country-Dancing-Meetup-Group/events/269854333/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Scottish-Country-Dancing-Meetup-Group/events/269854333/", "start_time": 1587510000.0, "end_time": 1587517200.0, "location": {"latitude": 33.95663, "longitude": -84.550705}, "name": "Scottish Country Dancing Class - CANCELLED DUE to CORONA VIRUS CONCERNS", "organiser": "Atlanta Area Scottish Country Dancers", "price": 4.0, "is_online": false, "summary": "", "description_html": "<p>Classes are cancelled until further notice when venues reopen and social gatherings are encouraged.

And you will be welcome - from the most tentative step to the boldest leap.</p> <p>So, don\u2019t let ideas about yourself or others stop you from coming. Come and find out. You\u2019re not too old or young, too fit or unfit, too able or inhibited, you\u2019re not too special or insignificant. You\u2019re not even too shy!</p> <p>The class happens twice a week every week.</p> <p>FIND OUT MORE: <a href=\"https://www.acalltodance.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.acalltodance.com</a></p> <p>What is 5Rhythms\u00ae?</p> <p>Created by Gabrielle Roth and practiced by tens of thousands worldwide, 5Rhythms\u00ae is a philosophy, perspective and a dynamic movement practice rooted in the principle that if you put the psyche in motion it will heal itself. Movement is both the medicine and the metaphor, reaching across all languages, cultures and age groups to transform suffering into art, art into awareness, and awareness into action. Wherever the 5Rhythms are practiced, a community is born to dance, to sweat, to change, to support, and to provide a safe space for each of us to shatter the ego\u2019s hold and awaken the juicy, unpredictable, fascinating, edge-walking, rock star part of ourselves that yearns to be free.</p> <p>The 5Rhythms\u00ae are also called a Wave. A Wave of energy and vitality that is different every time, because we are constantly changing. While the Rhythms are universal they move through us via our unique ways of experiencing and expressing ourselves. It's a simple practice, and yet its effects can be powerful and profound.</p> <p>The rhythms are made up of:<br/>Flowing - calls us through our body, to honour the feminine and arrive in this home called body.<br/>Staccato - calls us through our heart to honour the masculine and the beat of life.<br/>Chaos - calls us through our big mind to let our small mind rest, to let go of what doesn't matter.<br/>Lyrical - calls us through our imagination and helps us lighten up.<br/>Stillness - calls us to compassion.</p> <p>Sometimes the teacher might lead one Wave in a class, sometimes two or three. Sometimes the Waves are really obvious, sometimes more subtle. As you practice they will start to become a part of your own map of aliveness and you may notice them not just in the dance but in every area of your life. It's a wild and wonderful ride, and beginners are welcome!</p>", "tags": ["sporty", "romantic"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/a/8/highres_478434184.jpeg"}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/Dance-Night-Out/events/270073905/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/Dance-Night-Out/events/270073905/", "start_time": 1587511800.0, "end_time": 1587515400.0, "location": {"latitude": 41.679886, "longitude": -73.85482}, "name": "On-line Swing and Lindy Lessons.

Lisa Lin, Rice\u2019s Transportation Demand Manager will talk about that thing that all of us dread \u2013 the commute \u2013 and what we can do to reduce our footprint.

Simply put, if we shut down too much of the economy for too long, we may have a substantially damaged economy after the virus passes (Trump\u2019s \u201cthe cure is worse than the disease\u201d). While I suspect most of us believe that we should keep the economy closed for now (e.g., see the above HuPo article), the question is: when and how should we reopen?

A counter-point: anti-racist sentiments didn't cause us to miss-forecast COVID-19 because there were plenty of other factors that exerted a stronger influence on both our decision making and situational awareness. Examples include poor or inexperienced leadership, a misinformed international news media, interference from the CCP, a desire not to harm the economy, and more. All of these seem valid to me.

As facilitators, we reserve space to step in for conflict mediation in support of our shared goal of mutual understanding. Difficult conversations are expected given the polarity in our current political environment; however, we expect participants to cooperate with facilitators in mediation to transform conflict into understanding.</p> <p>We assume you agree with the following:<br/>* Consent \u2014 you are at choice to participate or not. By participating you consent to mediation if deemed necessary by facilitators.<br/>* Equity \u2014 we value and strive for equal time for all participants.<br/>* Free Expression \u2014 we are doing the best to express our views which may differ from other participants.<br/>* Emotional Safety \u2014 mutual respect is needed for safety. Personal attacks are not allowed.<br/>* Shared Understanding \u2014 our goal is to listen and understand, not to change anyone's mind.<br/>* Re-framing Judgments \u2014 occasionally, facilitators will invite a re-framing of judgments with curiosity into intrinsic motivations (universal human needs) being expressed.</p> <p>In the future, we may record and publish short videos that capture part of the conversation. We will get consent for video recording beforehand. These videos will be available online (on YouTube and elsewhere) and can be used by anyone under the most generous Creative Commons license.</p> <p>Here is the basic structure of our sessions:<br/>* Breathing Exercise/Guided Meditation: Help people settle and allow latecomers to join without having to catch up.<br/>* Check in: Share current emotional state/what\u2019s top of mind for you<br/>* Topics: A list of topics of interest are gathered<br/>* Voting: each participant replies to a poll, selecting the topics of interest to them<br/>* Ordering: topics are ordered by the number of votes received<br/>* Round: go around the room with every person given the opportunity to share<br/>* Empathy (optional): facilitator offers up a reflection of the heart of what was said</p> <p>Gifts of Money Welcomed: No one turned away for lack of funds (NOTAFLOF): Giving from a sense of \"obligation\" is toxic to relationships; and I want to offer the opportunity for you to contribute to my livelihood.

The more of our stash fabrics we get through, the more experience we gain and the more satisfying the sewing process can become.</p> <p>I must admit that I have not yet started the navy/cream velvet top I want to make - and that's because I am not sure that I picked a suitable pattern. I did start a sleeveless blouse with a different stash fabric (nothing to do with the velvet project just because I got the sudden urge). And I started a toile out of a newly bought and very cheap black jersey so I can evaluate the Lekala pattern I was going to use for my precious velvet. I also used a grey jersey fabric from my stash for a simple raglan sleeved top and now wonder if that mightn't be the best pattern for the velvet?</p> <p>Every practical bit that I get to do teaches me what works and what doesn't. Unfortunately I often stop at the stage of \"oh crikey I've run into a problem\" and never picked the project back up. That gets very frustrating. It makes such a nice change this time: I threw myself into sewing with any fabric and any pattern that mysteriously made its way onto my sewing table.

Colin Campbell, on the role of a whole food, plant-based (WFPB) diet in viral response.

Their far-ranging conversation will cover the various health benefits of eating a plant-based diet from a medical perspective. Importantly, they will speak to the reason why many of us, and our doctors, are unaware of the healing power of food. To this end, Dr. Klaper will also discuss the Moving Medicine Forward Initiative, which seeks to bring the revolutionary ideas of disease reversal through plant-based nutrition and lifestyle medicine to medical schools across the country.

See boilerplate below;</p> <p>We will be managing the RSVP/Wait List in favor of new players over players who have been with us for over 1 year AND/OR players attending other weekly D&amp;D 5e public play games. If you're a visitor to our Emerald City, let us know, you may get a jump on the Wait List! Ideally, in that year, you'll learn the game basics, make some friends, and find a home group.</p> <p>**Be sure you have your Profile set to alert you when you're confirmed for an event and respond to messages from the Event Organizers.**</p> <p>Games may be with mixed leveled characters, so a first time player with a level 1 character may sit next to a level 3 character. Play accordingly; hang back if you're weaker, protect your comrades if you're stronger. Decide if your party needs to fight, run, bully, bribe, or beg your way through the game.</p> <p>We are looking for Heroic Adventurers, so leave your evil, chaotic, solo, or morally questionable characters for your home game.</p> <p>You can find some premade characters here:<br/><a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/character_sheets\" class=\"linkified\">http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/character_sheets</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.fastcharacter.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.fastcharacter.com/</a></p> <p>Or you can build your own character using the standard set numbers (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or point buy on page 13 in the Players Handbook.

It's okay to bring several characters of various levels since you never know what table you'll play. We will be happy to sit and build a character with you AFTER the game since that can take 30-60 minutes.</p> <p>Fighters and Rogues are easier for new players to use to learn game basics. If you're playing a Spellcaster, you should bring your spell details on index cards, photocopies, or a digital spellbook (Fight Club 5th Edition by Lion's Den is a decent app), cell phones and tablets are okay to use but leave your laptops at home due to space limitations.</p> <p>We technically start at 6:30 but I want to add a 30-minute buffer to go over things for anyone new to Discord itself or role-playing on Discord.</p> <p>Please keep your RSVP up to date.

Read the New York Times review at <a href=\"https://nyti.ms/2R7NMqv\" class=\"linkified\">https://nyti.ms/2R7NMqv</a></p> <p>As the opera opens, a group of elegant socialites gather for a lavish dinner party, but when it is time to leave, no one is able to escape. As the days pass, their behavior becomes increasingly erratic and savage. The large ensemble cast tackles both the vocal and dramatic demands of Ad\u00e8s's score with one riveting performance after another. Tom Cairns directs an engrossing and inventive production, using a towering wooden archway to trap the characters onstage. Ad\u00e8s himself takes the podium to conduct the frenzied score.</p> <p>This emotionally thrilling opera provides fertile ground for conversation: the possible meanings of this surrealistic extravaganza and the relationship to our own lives in which we are all now trapped in our own restrictive environments, day after day, week after week.</p> <p>\"The Exterminating Angel\" is available online from The Met Opera On Demand. \"The Exterminating Angel\" opera can be accessed at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2X6LUCm\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2X6LUCm</a></p> <p>The opera may be rented for $4.99 or watched by signing up for an on-demand subscription.

English Passengers \u2013 Matthew Kneale</p> <p>A historical novel written by Matthew Kneale, which won the Whitbread Book Award and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Miles Franklin Award. It is narrated by 20 different characters and tells the story of a voyage to look for the Garden of Eden in Tasmania and the rapid decline of that island\u2019s indigenous population of Tasmanian Aborigines. In 1857 when Captain Illiam Quillian Kewley and his band of rum smugglers from the Isle of Man have most of their contraband confiscated by British Customs, they are forced to put their ship up for charter. The only takers are two eccentric Englishmen who want to embark for the other side of the globe. The Reverend Geoffrey Wilson believes the Garden of Eden was on the island of Tasmania. His travelling partner, Dr. Thomas Potter, unbeknownst to Wilson, is developing a sinister thesis about the races of men. Meanwhile, an aboriginal in Tasmania named Peevay recounts his people\u2019s struggles against the invading British, a story that begins in 1824, moves into the present with approach of the English passengers in 1857, and extends into the future in 1870. These characters and many others come together in a storm of voices that vividly bring a past age to life.</p> <p>2. Blood Meridian - Cormac McCarthy</p> <p>Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy is an epic novel of the violence and depravity that attended America's westward expansion, brilliantly subverting the conventions of the Western novel and the mythology of the Wild West. Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, it traces the fortunes of the Kid, a fourteen-year-old Tennessean who stumbles into a nightmarish world where Indians are being murdered and the market for their scalps is thriving.</p> <p>3. Tatty - Christine Dwyer Hickey</p> <p>Hailed by the critics as a masterpiece, Tatty is a devastating yet hilarious depiction of a troubled Dublin family, told through the lively, charismatic voice of a little girl over a 10-year period.</p> <p>During this time we see the destruction brought about by alcoholism as one little girl tries to come to terms with her parents' drinking. This is the story of a disturbed childhood, yet it is also filled with humour and love. Chapter by chapter, the child's voice matures and her perception becomes more honed; we are left with a stunning portrait of a disintegrating family and the child lost within it.</p> <p>S\u00e9amus</p>", "tags": ["geeky", "historic"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/e/0/highres_489774240.jpeg"}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/Two-Arrows-Zen-Artspace-Zendo-Salt-Lake-City/events/270061287/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/Two-Arrows-Zen-Artspace-Zendo-Salt-Lake-City/events/270061287/", "start_time": 1587474000.0, "end_time": 1587478500.0, "location": {"latitude": 40.764191, "longitude": -111.907158}, "name": "Daily Morning Meditation (Zazen) at Two Arrows Zen, Monday - Friday", "organiser": "Two Arrows Zen - Artspace Zendo, Salt Lake City", "price": 0, "is_online": false, "summary": "", "description_html": "<p>You are warmly welcome to join Michael Mugaku Zimmerman Roshi and the Two Arrows Zen sangha for morning meditation, Monday through Friday.</p> <p>There are two sitting periods: 7:00 - 7:35 am, and 7:45 - 8:15 am.

It is \"among [Celan's] most well-known and often-anthologized poems\". Despite critics claiming that the lyrical finesse and aesthetic of the poem did not do justice to the cruelty of the Holocaust, others regard the poem as one that \"combines mysteriously compelling imagery with rhythmic variations and structural patterns that are both elusive and pronounced\". At the same time it has been regarded as a \"masterful description of horror and death in a concentration camp\". Celan was born to a Jewish family in Cernauti, Romania (now Chernivtsy, Ukraine); his parents died in a camp during the Second World War, and Celan himself was a prisoner for a time in a work camp. The poem has reached international relevance by being considered to be one of the most important poems of the post-war period and the most relevant example of Tr\u00fcmmerliteratur.</p> <p>In 1967, Mart\u00edn Heidegger met with the poet Paul Celan, a Jew who had survived concentration camps operated by the Nazis' Romanian allies. On July 24 Celan gave a reading at the University of Freiburg, attended by Heidegger. Heidegger there presented Celan with a copy of What is Called Thinking?, and invited him to visit him at his hut at Todtnauberg, an invitation which Celan accepted. On July 25 Celan visited Heidegger at his retreat, signing the guestbook and spending some time walking and talking with Heidegger. The details of their conversation are not known, but the meeting was the subject of a subsequent poem by Celan, entitled \"Todtnauberg\" (dated August 1, 1967). The enigmatic poem and the encounter have been discussed by numerous writers on Heidegger and Celan, notably Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. A common interpretation of the poem is that it concerns, in part, Celan's wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.</p> <p>Todesfuge online text:<br/><a href=\"http://poemsintranslation.blogspot.com/2010/01/paul-celan-death-fugue-from-german.html?m=1\" class=\"linkified\">http://poemsintranslation.blogspot.com/2010/01/paul-celan-death-fugue-from-german.html?m=1</a></p> <p>Todtnauberg online text:<br/><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58209/todtnauberg\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58209/todtnauberg</a></p>", "tags": ["geeky"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": ""}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/Mocha-Girls-Read-Minneapolis/events/270055097/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/Mocha-Girls-Read-Minneapolis/events/270055097/", "start_time": 1587506400.0, "end_time": 1587510000.0, "location": {"latitude": -8.521147, "longitude": 179.1962}, "name": "Mocha Girl Stretch Time", "organiser": "Mocha Girls Read - Minneapolis", "price": 0, "is_online": true, "summary": "", "description_html": "<p>We are going to take 30 minutes to stretch with Mocha Girl Sherrae.</p> <p>Hello, my name is Sherrae.

Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?</p> <p>While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you\u2019ll hear the voices of people he interviewed - scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There\u2019s even a theme song - Janelle Monae\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d.</p> <p>Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know.

Now former government official and political commentator KT McFarland returns with tenacity, resolve, and the truth about the Trump Administration and those seeking to destroy it.</p> <p>For decades, KT McFarland has been one of the country\u2019s most prominent conservative foreign policy experts. She was part of the Trump Revolution from the beginning. As Trump\u2019s first Deputy National Security Advisor, she had a seat at the table for everything: Trump\u2019s unconventional campaign and upset victory; his throw-out-the-rule-book Trump Tower Transition; the chaotic first months in the West Wing; the unusual events surrounding General Flynn\u2019s firing; and the sprawling Mueller investigation.</p> <p>In Revolution, she walks the reader through the Washington Establishment\u2019s relentless efforts to destroy Trump, populism, and nationalism in order to keep their own hands on the levers of power. The Trump Revolution, like the Reagan Revolution and all the anti-Establishment political revolutions before it, will ultimately prevail. It is this ability to reinvent ourselves, not just as individuals but as a society, that lies at the heart of American Exceptionalism.</p> <p>When McFarland left the Trump Administration and Washington, she disappeared from public view and refused to discuss her experiences. Now, for the first time, McFarland tells a story that reads more like a political thriller than a tour through this unique moment in history. Written with unusual candor, with insights into Trump and his inner circle, Putin, Xi Jinping, and Kim Jong-un, McFarland\u2019s book is destined to become a classic.</p> <p>If you only read one book
