            "description_html": "<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Disposable nappies were created as parents increasingly wanted freedom from washing nappies. A former assistant beauty editor of America Vogue, Marion Donovan came from a family of inventors. She began creating plastic coverings for cloth nappies to stop leakage, using shower curtain material. In 1946 she patented \"the boater\" made from parachute cloth. It covered the cloth nappy. It was successfully marketed from 1949. </SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Procter and Gamble were the first company to make serious money out of the nappy with their own design that came later when they launched Pampers in the USA in 1961. The first pamper still lies in landfill with full biodegradability estimated at 150 years. The first disposable nappy was sold in Australia in 1965. Over 400 billion (an incomprehensible amount) of disposable nappies remain in landfills throughout the world.</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><EM><STRONG>Would you like to reduce waste and stop the use of disposable nappies?</STRONG></EM><SPAN> </SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>We are conducting a free information session on modern cloth nappies.

Sessions with her and her last workshop transform me and my relationship. The workshop helped me to create such a clarity not only in my relationship but in my entire life. One of words she said that really changed my way of thinking about life - \"things can be good but I am always looking for a ways to make it better\". That should be her workshop motto :-) With her knowledge and life experience she helped me to understand my relationship better. I realized what I've been doing wrong but mostly showed me that making changes in yourself first will help me to succeed not only in romantic relationships but in relationships in general. I came home after workshop and had great conversation with my partner with clear picture of what I want from this relationship and how we going to achieve our goals. Since that day my relationship has been becoming stronger and stronger and I was never that happy with my life. I would definitely recommend Kinga's workshop to anyone who struggle with their relationships or looking for a partner. As well as to people who are in good relationship but looking for a way to make it better and stronger.\u201d Kate Maczka<BR></P>\n<P><SPAN>\"Relationship workshop gave me some time away from my busy work life to think about my past relationships and some of my behaviours that haven't been serving me. I had some time to think through the types of activites I can focus in a resourful way to strengthen and attract new relationships versus remaining stuck with some of my unresourcful behaviours that haven't been serving me and have caused me pain in the past. I really enjoyed listening to others experiences in a supportive environment and loved the feedback from Kinga on what I need to focus on and work on when it comes to my relationships\" Sarah Harding</SPAN></P>\n<P>\"I recently attended one of Kinga\u2019s Relationship Workshops. She has nurture nature which immediately put me at ease. I was able to appreciate her confidence and intuition in dealing with our questions and concerns. I left the workshop with a re-energized attitude about my relationship. We all know that a good relation needs consistant nurturing and attention. Yet I know I can get complacent and end up not giving my partner my best. The workshop gave me few fresh perspectives on that. I have no hesitation in highly recommending Kinga's workshops. She is a great facilitar, relationship coach too. I look forward to future sessions.\u201c Tony Vaccher</P>",

Mit 600 Metern Umfang ist die Burg einer der gr\u00f6\u00dften Wehranlangen Nieder\u00f6sterreichs. Bei einem Rundgang durch die historischen R\u00e4umlichkeiten erleben wir die Geschichte des Geb\u00e4udes hautnah und erfahren in einer umfangreichen Ausstellung weitere spannende Details rund um die Burg Hardegg, die Familie Khevenh\u00fcller-Metsch und den Bruder von Kaiser Franz Joseph I. \u2013 Kaiser Maximilian I.</p> <p>-------------------------</p> <p>Wildkatzenf\u00fctterung</p> <p>Sie galt als ausgestorben in \u00d6sterreich und ist wieder da!

Seit Jahrzehnten galt die Wildkatze in \u00d6sterreich als ausgestorben, doch Proben beweisen: Sie ist zur\u00fcckgekehrt!<br/>Wildkatzen mit eigenen Augen erleben<br/>Obwohl es nahezu unm\u00f6glich ist, sie in freier Wildbahn zu sehen, bietet der Nationalpark Thayatal eine einmalige Chance, diese extrem scheuen Tiere zu erblicken. In \u00d6sterreichs gr\u00f6\u00dfter Wildkatzenanlage beim Nationalparkhaus Thayatal k\u00f6nnen Sie die Wildkatzen bei der Nahrungssuche, beim Herumklettern oder einfach nur beim Faulenzen beobachten.

It's time to make art again, together, online using Zoom, where we can see each other and share our art.</p> <p>This might be a new concept for some of you, but trust me, you can do it. It isn't complicated. First, sign up online with Zoom. Send me your email to my email address ([masked]). Then I will be able to send you an invitation from Zoom to join the group. (make sure you check your spam folder). On the day and time of the meetup just go to zoom and you will be part of the group. We will all be able to see each other and talk and visit and share our art. If you need help just let me know. Note: if you use your laptop you will be able to see everyone at the same time. If you use your phone, you won't be able see everyone.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing you at the party. Sorry you have to bring your own food and drinks and art supplies.

This year, AZREIA returns with three tracks of learning:</p> <p>\u2022 Core Skills Track: For those who are new or just beginning their journey into real estate investing, AZREIA has identified the \u201cCore Skills\u201d every real estate and rental property investor needs which include: comping and estimating properties and repairs, leveraging marketing for lead generation, and the art of negotiations.</p> <p>\u2022 Investing Solutions Track: Running a small business, regardless of the industry, the two most precious resources are money\u2026AND TIME! We are gathering local industry subject matter experts to discuss industry trends that affect the way business is done, which will give you more of the things you want back in your real estate business.</p> <p>\u2022 Alternative Investing Track: As discussed in the \u201cBlue Ocean Strategy,\u201d opportunity exists where others aren\u2019t looking or working. AZREIA explores the alternative investment strategies that have begun to emerge with the population and demographic changes that are happening in the Phoenix/Arizona landscape. This track is designed to help any investor diversify their portfolio and create their own \u201cblue ocean.\u201d</p> <p>AZREIA is also partnering with the Home Depot to create the \u201cHome Depot Pavilion,\u201d an experiential learning opportunity that focuses on critical areas of the home to showcase rehabbing trends in the kitchen and bathroom, and value adds to your next real estate project.</p> <p>Through the \u201cReal Estate Investing: Making It Work for You!\u201d 2020 Conference &amp; Expo, we are poised to bring together subject matter experts from Phoenix, Arizona and beyond to begin the conversation of where opportunities exist and what the 21st century real estate investor looks like. We are at a critical point as an industry to bring our community together to have a conversation around how real estate entrepreneurs can continue to leverage our ability to be Arizona housing providers and discuss what our part in the ongoing housing shortage looks like.</p>",

            "description_html": "<p>Imagine meeting and enjoying coffee with like minded, smart fellow investors at your favorite Cafe. That's what I'm trying to create here.</p> <p>Grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite alternate beverage), and lets have a discussion with some of the best, brightest, and most giving folks in the real estate investing world. This is a new world approach to an old (but good idea). The idea is for the more experienced members of the group to discuss, answer questions, and otherwise just HELP those with less experience. It's a simple concept really.<br/>Many years ago, we used to meet at Nick's Pancake House on Saturday mornings, but we quickly outgrew the available space. The food and service were great, but the acoustics, logistics of order taking/ delivery, and the inevitable side conversations made these unproductive.<br/>Enter 2020, COVID-19, and Zoom, and we have an awesome new opportunity. Not only are we able to avoid the aforementioned issues, but we have the added benefit of having investors able to join us from not just the immediate geographic area, but from ANYWHERE. This opens up amazing opportunities for the group that I hadn't really thought about a month ago.<br/>Anyway, my go forward plan is to continue to host Classes, Guest Speaker Events, Focused Mastermind Groups, a Rainmaker Group, and now, an ONLINE Cafe, which is a great NETWORKING and LEARNING Opportunity in a casual setting. We're also now getting much more active on Facebook with an A2REIC Page, and a Private VIP Member Group to which you're all invited.<br/>None of us are as smart as all of us, and as iron sharpens iron, one sharpens another.<br/>We have an incredibly awesome group of members, willing to share, give, and help each other not only survive, but ultimately thrive.<br/>I hope you'll join us. I believe you need to RSVP to get the Zoom link.<br/>I'll make it well worth your time. We'll finish early this week, so you can get on with your day.<br/>In the meantime, I hope you and your families are staying safe, and I look forward to a great session.</p>",

I'm not sure if the grass parking lot will be gated. If you decide to ride and use a trailer, plan on finding another parking area nearby. There is a school 1/4 mile north of TWoS on the same side of Hwy. 60. I heard guys have parked their trailers there in the past, but I don't know their policy/rules.</p> <p>I hope to make at least a couple of April rides, and will probably stop and wait for others at the gas station across the street. If you want to meet, check there and the paved parking lot of TWoS for others that might be going as well.</p> <p>I suggest packing a lunch to avoid restaurant stops during our rides.</p> <p>Stay away from others and stay healthy!

Sample produce items may include bananas, onions, cabbage, or potatoes - the food offered can vary from month to month, depending on what City Harvest has available. As the market-goers stop by each table, volunteers greet them-and then weigh and bag the produce, then distribute.</p> <p>That's it for now.

Thanks!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/1/e/600_437657950.jpeg\" /></p> <p>About City Harvest Healthy Neighborhoods Program</p> <p>Nearly 1.4 million New Yorkers are facing hunger and for many people that City Harvest serves, healthy food is unavailable and unaffordable. In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.</p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed Healthy Neighborhoods programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our Healthy Neighborhoods programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, after school programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded Healthy Neighborhoods programs to high-need communities across the five boroughs.</p>",

Consider participating in Over Story + Under Story. The two-part virtual meetup, led by Austin artist and Odditree Society founder Ann Armstrong, revolves around observing a tree of one\u2019s choosing over the course of a week. The week of lightly guided observation will be bookended by an initial digital meetup meeting to discuss the intent and underpinnings of the project, and a second to circle back to see what participants discovered and documented. This arboreal exploration aspires to: augment our connection to and awareness of our surrounding environment, create time and space for discovery, and expand this discovery through collective exploration/sharing of resulting travel guides.</p> <p>*If you don\u2019t have safe and convenient access to a tree at this time, we encourage you to revisit a tree from memory!</p> <p>Participants must sign up here: <a href=\"https://www.treefolks.org/event/artist-tree-workshop-with-anne-armstrong/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.treefolks.org/event/artist-tree-workshop-with-anne-armstrong/</a></p> <p>This Workshop has limited spots!

            "description_html": "<p>In one of our last in-person meetings, we considered questions about Jesus' wealth, leadership skills, and the breadth of his influence during his own lifetime. In recent times some scholars such as John Dominic Crossan argue that Jesus was just a peasant with very little influence in his own lifetime and that he died as a common, practically unknown insurrectionist. However upon reexamining the evidence we found that if Jesus started out poor and unknown, he and his family didn\u2019t end that way.</p> <p>Nothing more attests to his humble beginnings than the well-attested claim that he was from Nazareth, a very small and poor village. Yet it seems that during his lifetime he was able to win the financial backing of certain wealthy people, including from a family of the manager of domestic affairs of the ruler Herod Anitpas (Luke 8:3). There is such a high quantity of unrelated stories from various independent sources (e.g. Q, Mark, and John) that it seems historically likely that Jesus was well known and supported by certain people of power, for example: certain tax professionals (who represent a class of society well above poverty); a rich man named Joseph of Arimathea; and a powerful Pharisee named Nicodemus (though no corroborating evidence of him is found outside of the Gospel of John). And after Jesus\u2019 death the historian Josephus indicates that Jesus\u2019 brother/cousin James was a very influential figure in the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, which sociologically speaking, was a very long way away from Nazareth. If Jesus\u2019 family started out poor, the evidence suggests that they acquired significant status during Jesus\u2019s and James\u2019s lifetimes.</p> <p>In our next live meeting, we will continue down this line of questioning and discuss the following:</p> <p>1. Could the relationship between the families, the \"House of Caiaphas\" and the \"House of Jesus,\" be described as a feud? Did the High Priest Caiaphas consider Jesus a direct threat? Is Caiaphas' family responsible not only for the execution of Jesus, but also the execution of his brother/cousin, James?</p> <p>2. Did Jesus, in fact, have any alliances with certain Jewish and Roman leaders, perhaps with some who would have benefited from the removal of Caiaphas' family from the Jerusalem Temple?</p> <p>3. What divisions and alliances were forming in elite Roman circles at this time, and could Jesus have had any participation in them?</p> <p>Join us for what guarantees to be a thoughtful discussion!</p> <p>Topic: Historical Jesus Meetup<br/>Time: Apr 25,[masked]:00 AM Mountain Time (US and Canada)</p> <p>Join Zoom Meeting<br/><a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/99295242198\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/j/99295242198</a></p> <p>*****************************<br/>To find the time in your timezone, simply click this link: <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Historical+Jesus+Academy+Live+Discussion&amp;iso=20200425T10&amp;p1=75&amp;ah=1&amp;am=30\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Historical+Jesus+Academy+Live+Discussion&amp;iso=20200425T10&amp;p1=75&amp;ah=1&amp;am=30</a><br/>*****************************</p> <p>Meeting ID:[masked]<br/>One tap mobile<br/>[masked],,[masked]# US (Houston)<br/>[masked],,[masked]# US (San Jose)</p> <p>Dial by your location<br/>[masked] US (Houston)<br/>[masked] US (San Jose)<br/>[masked] US (San Jose)<br/>[masked] US (Chicago)<br/>[masked] US (New York)<br/>[masked] US<br/>[masked] US<br/>Meeting ID:[masked]<br/>Find your local number: <a href=\"https://zoom.us/u/adYNbJulAy\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/u/adYNbJulAy</a></p>",

            "description_html": "<p>In the late ninth century, Caliph al-Ma\u2019mun commissioned a measurement of Earths circumference. Al-Ma\u2019mun dispatched two groups to the desert to find a specific location by following the stars. One group walked north and the other south, tracking the stars for one degree. They counted their paces and then walked back and averaged the measurement. The two groups then multiplied by 360 to derive a circumference of 24,480 miles. The modern value is 24,901 miles - less than 2% more accurate than the determination of al-Ma\u2019mun and his team. In physics Fermi's order of estimation (named after physicist Enrico Fermi) teaches approximation via the \u201cback of the envelop method.\u201d Fermi estimations typically involve making justified guesses about quantities but are often accurate when using logic to deduce a solution. These calculations are accurate because the methods lack consistent bias. But whether its Femi's order of estimation or Caliph al-Ma\u2019mun\u2019s measurement of the Earths circumference, the ability to make these assertions stems from a generalized understanding of the world.</p> <p>This raises an enduring and intriguing question: is developing a broad set of interests and skills more effective than focusing on and excelling in one area? The book \u201cRange\u201d examines some of the world\u2019s most effective people and claims generalists, not specialists, are better primed to excel. Author David Epstein asserts that a broad range of interests nurturers creativity and results in a greater ability in deducing meaningful connections. From professional athletes to Nobel laureates, the author claims early specialization is the exception, not the rule when excelling professionally.</p> <p>Epstein even uses himself as an example, stating he committed \u201cstatistical malpractice\u201d while earning his master\u2019s degree. While studying geology in grad school, he feels that having focused on narrow specialized information, without understanding the underlying processes, impeded his ability to discern the root cause of the problem his research aimed to solve. More broadly, Epstein attributes the pervasive replication crisis plaguing science to the narrowly focused specialization among researchers.</p> <p>Another reoccurring theme is limited experiences create bias that in turn diminishes the capacity to make accurate judgments. Conversely, those enjoying diverse ranges of experiences tend to have a greater opportunity to develop more nuanced understanding of reality. Those who are specialized may tend to be more narrowly focused, impeding their ability to process new information/data in a meaningful manner. People who proactively step outside their area of expertise can see \u201cthe big picture\u201d, which is often required for developing sound judgment. Generalists can draw on a large array of sources to test their ideas/hypotheses which would be more difficult with a narrowly focused view of the world.</p> <p>We will discuss the pros and cons associated with being a generalists.</p> <p>Resources:</p> <p>Range Ted Talk: How Falling Behind Can Get You Ahead | David Epstein | TEDxManchester<br/>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ2_BwqcFsc\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ2_BwqcFsc</a></p> <p>Range: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-61Y7ytK6zc\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-61Y7ytK6zc</a></p> <p>In Praise of Misfits: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2012/06/02/in-praise-of-misfits\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.economist.com/business/2012/06/02/in-praise-of-misfits</a></p> <p>Questions to think about?</p> <p>Do you think it\u2019s better to be a generalists or to specialize in a specific area?</p> <p>What are some the benefits of being a generalists?</p> <p>What are some the advantages come with specialization?</p> <p>Is it better to be \u201cinterested\u201d in a wide range of things and not know what we do?</p> <p>What are the tradeoffs in having a broad set of interest\u2019s vs specializing in a specific area?</p> <p>How has industrialization impacted our ability to be generalists?</p> <p>I am adding one additional video for your edification but it is unlikely we\u2019ll have time to cover its contents: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6XEDcD_C4\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6XEDcD_C4</a></p>",

Scot Hicks, that is fairly easy to understand.<br/>The name of the book is: The Emperor's Handbook: A New Translation of The Meditations<br/>For this meeting we'll be focusing on Book 11 Part 2 of the Meditations.<br/>The readings will follow our usual format, where every participant will read a paragraph.<br/>The content will be displayed on a shared screen, but I highly recommend getting this excellent book, especially if you join on a small screen such as cell phone.</p> <p>The link to join the meetup online will be added timely before we start..<br/>You can use computer video/audio or your regular phone line for audio only.<br/>If you need any technical help, please let me know.</p> <p>\u2022 Why we meet<br/>The goal of this group is to discuss how to apply Stoicism to our daily lives and how we can get better at it.<br/>You don't need to be an academic or have any sort of philosophy training to join this group.<br/>The best contribution you can make is to tell a short personal story, how some of the text we read, applied to an experience you have actually had.</p> <p>\u2022 Where we meet<br/>This meeting will be online. At the date and time of meetup (maybe 10 minutes before), click the online event link, on this page, and follow the instructions.</p> <p>\u2022 Important to know<br/>The focus of this group is self-improvement and socializing.<br/>Though I encourage people to be politically active, we don't want to get into political discussions at our Stoicism meetups.</p>",

These are topics of humanist interest, from a humanist perspective.</p> <p>The topic of the discussion will be decided in a prior meeting, usually two weeks in advance. This week\u2019s topic is: \"Was Thomas Malthus Chicken Little?\"</p> <p>In 1798, the English cleric and economist Thomas Malthus published An Essay on the Principle of Population. He wrote that \u201cthe increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence,\u201d \u201cpopulation does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase,\u201d and \u201cthe superior power of population is repressed by moral restraint, vice, and misery.\u201d</p> <p>Malthus\u2019s notion that population growth would outstrip the food supply has been proven to be wrong over the last two centuries. There were two things that Malthus missed:</p> <p>1) Human ingenuity would raise the productivity of agriculture to more than meet the needs of a growing population.</p> <p>2) Abundance actually lowers fertility rates, rather than raise them as Malthus assumed. Fertility rates have fallen dramatically around the globe, so much so that some demographers are predicting that the world\u2019s population will peak at 11 billion and then decline.</p> <p>Yet, to this day, Malthusian thinking is still prevalent in some circles.</p> <p>Discussion Questions</p> <p>1) Does Malthusianism have any merit?</p> <p>2) Why do Malthusian predictions persist?</p> <p>3) Sadly, there are still some people today that face food shortages. Is this due to shortages in the capacity to produce food, the production of food, or are there other factors at play?</p> <p>4) Why are people today around the world having fewer children than their ancestors?</p> <p>5) Has urbanization played a role in the failure of Malthusianism?</p> <p>Meet our diverse group, trade perspectives in a free and open forum and learn from others as they learn from you!</p> <p>BTW: our online meetings have been very popular. Many HAT members attend regularly but don\u2019t sign up on Meetup so there are usually more attendees than sign ups. Please keep your RSVP up to date and try to sign in a bit before 11 a.m. as we will be assigning attendees to smaller break-out groups for the first part of the discussion.</p> <p>NOTE: The HAT Forum adheres strictly to the City of Toronto Policy on Non-Discrimination (<a href=\"http://www.the519.org/public/content/policy-files/The519SpaceUsePolicy.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.the519.org/public/content/policy-files/The519SpaceUsePolicy.pdf</a>)</p> <p>Our Website (<a href=\"http://www.humanisttoronto.ca/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.humanisttoronto.ca/</a>)</p> <p>N.B.

The more of our stash fabrics we get through, the more experience we gain and the more satisfying the sewing process can become.</p> <p>I must admit that I have not yet started the navy/cream velvet top I want to make - and that's because I am not sure that I picked a suitable pattern. I did start a sleeveless blouse with a different stash fabric (nothing to do with the velvet project just because I got the sudden urge). And I started a toile out of a newly bought and very cheap black jersey so I can evaluate the Lekala pattern I was going to use for my precious velvet. I also used a grey jersey fabric from my stash for a simple raglan sleeved top and now wonder if that mightn't be the best pattern for the velvet?</p> <p>Every practical bit that I get to do teaches me what works and what doesn't. Unfortunately I often stop at the stage of \"oh crikey I've run into a problem\" and never picked the project back up. That gets very frustrating. It makes such a nice change this time: I threw myself into sewing with any fabric and any pattern that mysteriously made its way onto my sewing table. I will tackle the velvet, I promise!</p> <p>What are you making, what kinds of stash fabric have you used recently and which do you think you might use next? Pictures please!</p>",

RSVPing only on the Meetup page, doesn't allow you to attend the Event.</p> <p>ABOUT THE EVENT</p> <p>What a time we are in?! Uncertain, challenging, difficult and disturbing times. However, we need to settle down and not to panic. So many people are struggling to cope up the psychological strain and meditation would come in handy.</p> <p>We used to host Meditation Happy Hours, where we meditate together and go our for drinks. Unfortunately, we could not do so, in the present situation. However, we migrated it to an online event. Our Coach gives us a brief run down of the event and leads the session. After the session we will get to socialize for few minutes.</p> <p>When you purchase a ticket, you will be emailed the Event ID and Password.</p> <p>Payment Instructions :</p> <p>1. You should login from a PC to see the 'Pay Now' button, after RSVPing. Then hit the button.</p> <p>2. Verify correct dollar amount for number of people you're paying for.</p> <p>3. If you don't have a Paypal account, click \"Pay with a Debit or Credit Card\".</p> <p>4. If you have a Paypal account, simply log in, and pay as you normally would via Paypal.</p> <p>Refund &amp; Ticket Resell</p> <p>All sales are final. We only refund the full amount, if the event is canceled. If it is rescheduled, we will send an email to those who RSVPed 'YES' advising that. A full refund will be given to those that let us know within 2 calendar days of the update email, if you are unable to make it on the new date. No refunds will be given after that time.</p> <p>However, you can sell your ticket to someone else if you are unable to attend. Please, feel free to post in the comment box for the event, that you have a ticket for sale. Work out payment between yourselves, and have the seller only send the organizer a message letting us know the full name of the person taking your spot.

The low-impact exercises help to lower the risk of aches &amp; pains in the joints during the workout. Therefore, you can focus on the workout and allow the muscles to take on all the suffering...in a good way!</p> <p>You will go through a series of dynamic body movements abiding by a timed interval sequence using anything and everything we have at our disposal. Work at your own pace. Let your body acclimate to the program. The more often you show up the better your body adapts. After a few workouts crank it up and really burn off those pesky extra calories.</p> <p>Remember, just because it is low impact does not mean it's low intensity. You will see amazing improvements in your fitness levels and your waistline.</p>",

            "description_html": "<p>COVID19 Update: We are still meeting, but we are less \"groupy\" than we used to be for the time being. We are observing social distancing at all times and are trying not to run as a big group in order to ensure adequate spacing for other runners along the route. It is highly advised to bring your own water because some of our water stops are not operational and that is may not change for a few months. Stay healthy!</p> <p>The most important thing is to find us! I feel bad when people sign up but don't find us and give up. We are always at the concrete marker at the entry to Centennial Gardens (aka Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion). So, Google 'Centennial Gardens' and you should get very close. The concrete marker at the entrance is right by the major parking lot at the north side of Hermann Park.</p> <p>Since we tend to be a small group (6 to 12 people most times) we mostly run together on a 5 mile loop that includes Hermann Park and a loop around Rice University, which can easily be cut to a 2 mile run, because we loop close to the starting point before heading towards the Rice campus loop. We try to adjust the pace to keep everyone at a light conversational pace as best we can, and there are four working water fountains along the route and in summer we try to visit three.</p> <p>The combo Hermann/Rice loop is much less crowded than Memorial Park, yet still provides softer crushed gravel trails for our delicate feet, plus the added bonus of being nearly 100% shaded.</p> <p>Map of course. Red- 2 mile Hermann park portion, yellow- Rice 2.9 mile loop portion. Multiple water fountains available at Miller Outdoor Theatre, Rice Blvd, and University Blvd. Restrooms available at Miller and Centennial Gardens (opens at 9 AM).</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/9/6/600_441354422.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Location of Meetup:</p> <p>Waiting in front of (or sitting on top of) the concrete sign Centennial Gardens as shown below in parking lot C you will most often find members Andy, Evan or Nat - with a rotating cast of occasional runners.</p> <p>Stephen (pronounced Steff-un), the listed host, is the spiritual guide for the group, rarely physically present but as the originating sponsor his legacy lives on.</p> <p>We recommend that any interested runners look us up on our sister running group on Facebook that meets every Thursday night at 7pm, the Radar Runners located at Under the Radar Brewery in Midtown.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/RADARRUNNING/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/RADARRUNNING/</a></p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/1/4/600_441355060.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/3/d/600_441355101.jpeg\" /></p> <p>LOCATION for Post-run activities is wherever you want to roam! We used to try to have an organized gathering point but over time that has withered away. However a few of us do tend to clean up after the run and reconvene at Java Lava for the breakfast of champions (bacon, eggs and potatoes for me with a latte, but Nat prefers a nice Pilsner).</p> <p>Wishing you good running!</p>",

            "description_html": "<p>Is it possible to feed our growing human population a healthy diet while simultaneously respecting the environmental limits of our Earth? Can our diets hold the key to reducing the incidence of human disease and helping to prevent worldwide environmental catastrophe? A growing body of research has arisen to answer these questions. The consensus is that it is possible! We can do it, but it will require a radical transformation of global human dietary patterns.</p> <p>In this webinar, \"Good for You and Good for the Earth: How a sustainable healthy diet can make a world of difference,\" Rev. Beth Love of Eat for the Earth will share about the connections between our diets and the wellbeing of the Earth system. She will be joined by nutrition expert Sandi Rechenmacher, who will illuminate the basics of nutritious eating. It turns out that eating in a way that is good for the earth is also good for you! You will learn about the particular human dietary pattern that holds tremendous benefit for human health, environmental sustainability, and the cause of a world in which all people can be adequately nourished. You will have the opportunity to have your questions answered and to find out how to get involved in the movement for change.</p> <p>A sustainable healthy diet is good for you, good for the Earth, and confers tremendous additional benefits. Are you ready to reap the rewards?</p> <p>Note, you can RSVP \"yes\" here on Meetup to indicate your intent to participate.

Please sign onto the Meetup page if you are interested in joining.</p> <p>*Summary*</p> <p>A volcanic island has been discovered on the southern coast of the mainland. Control of this volcano and the red crystals within will be key to defining the mainland kingdom as a world power in the years to come. You and your companions are embarking with a military expedition to establish a base of operations on the volcano, and exterminate the monster threat which plague the land.</p> <p>This is a Hexcrawler across a entire continent. Survive against not just monsters, but the weather, disease, injuries, starvation, thirst, time, and the terrain itself. A open ended adventure for those wanting to explore the unknown.</p> <p>*Optional Rules*</p> <p>Energy Crystals: This world has crystals which can store and release the energies of the universe. When a player cast's a spell, they may consume a crystal to change the damage type to a type specified by the crystals type<br/>You may also spend a crystal to change the damage type for all ranged or melee attacks until the end of the round.</p> <p>Expertise: Your character is a expert in a particular skill. Upon character creation, each character may choose one feat from the UA Skill Feats. (You must be proficient with the skill, and no attribute bonus)<br/><a href=\"https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UA-SkillFeats.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UA-SkillFeats.pdf</a></p> <p>Environmental Hazards: I will be designing new terrain to add variety to combat.</p> <p>Flanking (+2): Instead of advantage, flanking provides a +2 to hit.</p> <p>Action Options: Climb onto a bigger creature<br/>Action Options: Disarm<br/>Action Options: Overrun<br/>Action Options: Shove Aside<br/>Encumbrance (I will do the bookkeeping, but feel free to double check)<br/>Equipment Sizes<br/>Feats<br/>Firearms, Explosives (Renaissance Only)<br/>Hitting Cover<br/>Injuries<br/>Disease<br/>Massive Damage<br/>Flanking (+2)</p> <p>*Restrictions*</p> <p>No Evil Races</p> <p>Race needs to pass as human - People in the city states are xenophobic, especially with the discovery of a humanoid monster on the island. Non humans are being purged from society, so the PC must be able to pass for human.</p> <p>No Outlander background. The wildlife outside the cities makes living in the wilds nigh impossible.</p> <p>*Changes*</p> <p>Goodberry consumes its material component<br/>Foraging only brings enough food and water for one person.<br/>The Rangers \"Natural Explorer\" Ability is reworked with the following abilities.<br/>- Advantage on Navigation Checks<br/>- Advantage on Perception Checks<br/>- When you forage for food, you can feed an additional person.</p>",

The only rule is that you need to have enough cards in Arena or enough wildcards to convert whatever card you pick. If you've played a few drafts, you realistically aren't going to need many wildcards, but if you're a limited-only player, this is basically the only way to burn those wildcards you'll otherwise never use.</p> <p>Make sure you have Arena downloaded, account created, and the app loaded.</p> <p>Before the event starts, I'll post the session ID in discord so we can all jump in. Event is free. The big up is we're drafting with other people we know and we'll have voice chat. We've done this a few times now, and the results were pretty good.</p>",

            "description_html": "<p>Until we are able to return to playing FtF we will hold PSASL Game Days virtually. Our first Virtual Game Day will be April 25. We will use VASL to play the games.<br/>As with our game days at Around the Table we ask that you RSVP on our Meetup site by Tuesday so we can continue to pair players prior to game day. Pairings will be published on Wednesday.<br/>It would be helpful in making the pairings if we know your comfort level with VASL. When you RSVP please let us know how comfortable you are with using VASL to play ASL. A simple low, medium or high will be sufficient. We will try to pair players so that we can help each other with learning the VASL system. Having just started playing VASL, I\u2019ve found playing with someone who\u2019s familiar with VASL shallows the learning curve significantly.<br/>While not necessary, our hope is games will be played during the normal Game Day time slot. Consider it a way of preserving the time slot so that when we return to FtF game days the routine is still in place.<br/>I\u2019m pretty certain this will be a work in progress. If you have a suggestion on how to improve the virtual game day experience please contact me.<br/>I look forward to \u201cseeing\u201d you on the 25th.<br/>Greg</p>",

From the day old Nana Reja found a baby abandoned under a bridge, the life of a small Mexican village forever changed. Disfigured and covered in a blanket of bees, little Simonopio is for some locals the stuff of superstition, a child kissed by the devil. But he is welcomed by landowners Francisco and Beatriz Morales, who adopt him and care for him as if he were their own. As he grows up, Simonopio becomes a cause for wonder to the Morales family, because when the uncannily gifted child closes his eyes, he can see what no one else can--visions of all that's yet to come, both beautiful and dangerous. Followed by his protective swarm of bees and living to deliver his adoptive family from threats--both human and those of nature--Simonopio's purpose in Linares will, in time, be divined. Set against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution and the devastating influenza of 1918, The Murmur of Bees captures both the fate of a country in flux and the destiny of one family that has put their love, faith, and future in the unbelievable.</p>",

Our health is at risk, our financial futures are at risk and here we are stuck in our own little worlds inside. Hopefully your home feels safe to you.</p> <p>I have invited a very close friend and excellent, compassionate Marriage &amp; Family Therapist, Robin Stuart to lead a discussion to help navigate our feelings through these times. She has over 30 years experience in supporting and guiding people to better embrace where they are now as well as finding new possibilities for brighter days tomorrow.</p> <p>We want you to feel safe to join this meeting so you have the option of leaving your videos off and creating a nickname on your zoom profile if you like. You don't even need to RSVP here if you are not comfortable although I think it will be easier for others to sign up if there are some people to get it started.</p> <p>Robin will set some structure and guidelines for the discussion similar to those in a group therapy session including a verbal confidentiality agreement and will be leading the discussion.</p> <p>This is a good time to share your vulnerability and challenges with others who can relate. This will not be like our happy hour where we chat, tell jokes and play games... This is a space to give and receive support while a safe space is being held.</p> <p>Please note: The discussion on this day is free of charge and is not considered an official client/therapist relationship. However, after this week, Robin will be offering an opportunity to continue on with her in a group for a very manageable fee.</p> <p>I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US IF YOU FEEL THIS DISCUSSION WILL PROVIDE VALUE</p> <p>ZOOM APP- Meeting I.D.

With that in mind, I think it\u2019s still worth doing whatever we can. Every bit of personal clarity is worth having, whether we want to solve the world\u2019s problems, or just want to have a better idea of what those problems are in each others\u2019 minds.</p> <p>We won\u2019t so much discuss what policies need to be changed, as we'll determine how the current federal government is involved in providing us with essential resources, services, and protections, and how each of us would prefer those resources, services, and protections to be provided. The way you feel about how a government should do right by you is probably informed by loftier principles, and my hope is that this exercise will reveal some of those principles in each of us. It\u2019s an attempt at enabling us to better understand each other.</p> <p>Although there are many different types of government, as Americans we largely tend to see our own constitution and the way it manifests itself as a tug-of-war between Socialist and Capitalist concepts: Medicare, Social Security, and Veterans Affairs are Socialistic, and private ownership and the profit motive are Capitalistic. So let\u2019s find out where we really stand along that scale with respect to various resources, services, and protections.</p> <p>The spectrum of federal government involvement we\u2019re considering range from \u201cHands off,\u201d in which you (and your locality) are on your own, no national government participation whatsoever, to \u201cAll in,\u201d in which the federal government controls and provides all aspects of a resource (goods and services). We\u2019ll be able to aggregate our individual preferences and generate weighted scores in 15 \u2013 20 categories.</p> <p>I've provided a Google Docs preview of the criteria we'll be evaluating for this event: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLXtWazVJJt0amW5FbYFH0yFqq4kry76qDqzuLSeQ0I/edit?usp=sharing\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLXtWazVJJt0amW5FbYFH0yFqq4kry76qDqzuLSeQ0I/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>",

However, the circumstances we face tell us this is the right thing to do for now. Our guests from around the country face travel restrictions that make their attendance very difficult if not impossible. Here at home, some of our members have medical conditions that compromise their resistance to disease, and we do not wish to endanger any of them. The continuing political uncertainty has wreaked havoc on planning, and while we still hope that by April 25th it will appear this was unnecessary, we feel it is better to have a clear plan going forward from today.</p> <p>We will be announcing more specifics over the next week as a few details get ironed out, and we will be in touch with all members in good standing with the appropriate new registration links and contact information. It is our intent to move national candidate presentations off the program and onto the website, and have the only candidates making presentations during the convention being those seeking Utah offices. We will have the opportunity to nominate Utah candidates, and conduct other internal party business. We also still intend to conduct a presidential candidate and LNC Chair preference poll, for which details will be announced soon.</p> <p>If you have purchased either lunch during the convention or a ticket to the Friday night reception, we will be offering a refund if you wish. Details will be emailed soon to those who made purchases.</p> <p>Stay strong, stay safe, stay healthy. We are disappointed that we will not gather in person this year, but remain focused on nominating and promoting our candidates for office, and most importantly on promoting the ideals of liberty and the fundamental value of every unique individual, the real backbone of a vibrant, thriving nation.</p>",

With One Person, No Vote, she chronicles a related history: the rollbacks to African American participation in the vote since the 2013 Supreme Court decision that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Known as the Shelby ruling, this decision effectively allowed districts with a demonstrated history of racial discrimination to change voting requirements without approval from the Department of Justice.</p> <p>Focusing on the aftermath of Shelby, Anderson follows the astonishing story of government-dictated racial discrimination unfolding before our very eyes as more and more states adopt voter suppression laws. In gripping, enlightening detail she explains how voter suppression works, from photo ID requirements to gerrymandering to poll closures. In a powerful new afterword, she examines the repercussions of the 2018 midterm elections. And with vivid characters, she explores the resistance: the organizing, activism, and court battles to restore the basic right to vote to all Americans.</p> <p>Election Meltdown Amazon Summary:<br/>From the nation\u2019s leading expert, an indispensable analysis of key threats to the integrity of the 2020 American presidential election</p> <p>As the 2020 presidential campaign begins to take shape, there is widespread distrust of the fairness and accuracy of American elections. In this timely and accessible book, Richard L. Hasen uses riveting stories illustrating four factors increasing the mistrust. Voter suppression has escalated as a Republican tool aimed to depress turnout of likely Democratic voters, fueling suspicion. Pockets of incompetence in election administration, often in large cities controlled by Democrats, have created an opening to claims of unfairness. Old-fashioned and new-fangled dirty tricks, including foreign and domestic misinformation campaigns via social media, threaten electoral integrity. Inflammatory rhetoric about \u201cstolen\u201d elections supercharges distrust among hardcore partisans.</p> <p>Taking into account how each of these threats has manifested in recent years\u2014most notably in the 2016 and 2018 elections\u2014Hasen offers concrete steps that need to be taken to restore trust in American elections before the democratic process is completely undermined.</p>",

The more of our stash fabrics we get through, the more experience we gain and the more satisfying the sewing process can become.</p> <p>I must admit that I have not yet started the navy/cream velvet top I want to make - and that's because I am not sure that I picked a suitable pattern. I did start a sleeveless blouse with a different stash fabric (nothing to do with the velvet project just because I got the sudden urge). And I started a toile out of a newly bought and very cheap black jersey so I can evaluate the Lekala pattern I was going to use for my precious velvet. I also used a grey jersey fabric from my stash for a simple raglan sleeved top and now wonder if that mightn't be the best pattern for the velvet?</p> <p>Every practical bit that I get to do teaches me what works and what doesn't. Unfortunately I often stop at the stage of \"oh crikey I've run into a problem\" and never picked the project back up. That gets very frustrating. It makes such a nice change this time: I threw myself into sewing with any fabric and any pattern that mysteriously made its way onto my sewing table. I will tackle the velvet, I promise!</p> <p>What are you making, what kinds of stash fabric have you used recently and which do you think you might use next? Pictures please!</p>",

I love doing this event because I get through a book or two in one day.</p> <p>On April 25th the Challenge of reading ALL DAY long starts. During the bi-annual read-a-thon we will read books, post to our blogs, Facebook and Twitter or Goodreads about our reading, and visit other readers\u2019 blogs. We will also participate in mini-challenges throughout the day to win prizes. (I love that part!) This event happens twice a year, in April and in October. It was created by a book lover named Dewey. The first one was held in October 2007. Dewey died in late 2008. The read-a-thon was renamed to honor its founder in 2009.</p> <p>On April 25th the Dewey\u2019s 24 Hour Read-A-Thon ( <a href=\"https://www.24hourreadathon.com/october-2019-reader-sign-up/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.24hourreadathon.com/october-2019-reader-sign-up/</a> ) will start at 5 am for California. If you want to learn more and to sign up, click on the link. There is no money involved and it\u2019s purely for the love of reading on your own pace, for as long or as little as you want.</p> <p>Go to <a href=\"http://www.24hourreadathon.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.24hourreadathon.com/</a> to learn more and to sign up! Every six hours I will (try to) post a reminder for you to check our book club website with the links to the hourly challenge and Mocha Girls Read challenges. Yes! You can win prizes if you join in.</p> <p>You don't need to have a blog to participate.</p> <p>This is an online event and the Dewey website is the host site you check in every couple of hours. This is the best event to get through a few books on your nightstand.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>",

But if we pause and look deeper, we can begin to see that there is space to cultivate and tend to what we are experiencing in our hearts, bodies and minds.</p> <p>In this half day retreat, we'll turn our attention towards the 10 Paramis (Perfections); with a specific look at Renunciation, Wisdom and Generosity. Creating space for greater benevolence, compassion and tenderness to arise.</p> <p>ABOUT OUR GUIDE<br/>Booker brings her heart, wisdom, and compassion to the intersection of social justice, yoga, and mindfulness. She offers lectures, workshops, and retreats across the country utilizing social justice principles along with embodied wisdom practices to support the sustainability of front line changemakers, and those in direct service. She has been sharing the practices of mindfulness and yoga to incarcerated and system-involved youth since 2007, currently serving as the Director of Trainings for Lineage Project, and brought mindful yoga and meditation to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She co-founded the Yoga Service Council at Omega Institute and Urban Sangha Project in NYC. Booker is on faculty with the Prison Mindfulness Institute, Spirit Rock\u2019s Mindful Yoga and Meditation training, and Off the Mat, Into the World.</p> <p>Learn more about Booker:<br/><a href=\"https://kripalu.org/presenters-programs/presenters/leslie-booker\" class=\"linkified\">https://kripalu.org/presenters-programs/presenters/leslie-booker</a></p> <p>Check out our moving conversation:<br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlackWomensAlliance/videos/654334271777612/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/BlackWomensAlliance/videos/654334271777612/</a></p>",

I love doing this event because I get through a book or two in one day.</p> <p>On April 25th the Challenge of reading ALL DAY long starts. During the bi-annual read-a-thon we will read books, post to our blogs, Facebook and Twitter or Goodreads about our reading, and visit other readers\u2019 blogs. We will also participate in mini-challenges throughout the day to win prizes. (I love that part!) This event happens twice a year, in April and in October. It was created by a book lover named Dewey. The first one was held in October 2007. Dewey died in late 2008. The read-a-thon was renamed to honor its founder in 2009.</p> <p>On April 25th the Dewey\u2019s 24 Hour Read-A-Thon ( <a href=\"https://www.24hourreadathon.com/october-2019-reader-sign-up/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.24hourreadathon.com/october-2019-reader-sign-up/</a> ) will start at 8 am for New York. If you want to learn more and to sign up, click on the link. There is no money involved and it\u2019s purely for the love of reading on your own pace, for as long or as little as you want.</p> <p>Go to <a href=\"http://www.24hourreadathon.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.24hourreadathon.com/</a> to learn more and to sign up! Every six hours I will (try to) post a reminder for you to check our book club website with the links to the hourly challenge and Mocha Girls Read challenges. Yes! You can win prizes if you join in.</p> <p>You don't need to have a blog to participate.</p> <p>This is an online event and the Dewey website is the host site you check in every couple of hours. This is the best event to get through a few books on your nightstand.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>",

Those that RSVP will receive a link by email, which you can use to quickly and automatically download and install the Zoom software, if you don't already have it. You can then use that same link to connect to our Meetup. I will also post the link to the Meetup site on the morning of the Meetup.</p> <p>I recommend using a computer or tablet with a microphone, headphones, and speaker; however, it's possible to use your phone as long as you are in a quiet place. If you have a camera, I recommend enabling video, which will help make the connection more personal.</p> <p>Until our next Meetup, please continue spreading, reading, or listening to Messages of Goodness!</p> <p>To avoid spending a lot of money, please check out the following options:</p> <p>1. Purchase an inexpensive, used version, generally found online<br/>2. Check out an audible or hard copy from your local library<br/>3. Scan YouTube for summaries<br/>4. Check the OverDrive app, which works with your local libraries for audible/ebooks.</p> <p>Hope to meet or see you soon!<br/>Frances</p>",

The reviews for it are interesting. the people that like it absolutely love it. 61% of its readers gave it 5 stars! that's a pretty good chunk. we tend to be pretty selfish with our stars, in this book club, so i'm excited to see how we will feel about it. the people that wrote bad reviews on it are absolute in their disdain for what has become such a popular book. will any of those people be among us in april? hmmm...</p> <p>i am hoping that late april will be enough time to get through the fear that the corona-virus has brought.

Banks travels to the seething, labyrinthine city of his memory in hopes of solving the mystery of his own, painful past, only to find that war is ravaging Shanghai beyond recognition-and that his own recollections are proving as difficult to trust as the people.</p>",

Do whatever project you're working on or none at all!xt</p> <p>Unfortunately I won't be able to share supplies because we'll be remote but even if you're just there to chat and hangout, that's great!
