I'm passionate about the power of breath and I enjoy the daily health benefits the breath-training provides. I teach students to freedive up to 30m depth. I train others and myself so I can keep exploring the beauties of the ocean on a single breath. I spent more than 25 years of my life in the water - as a competitive swimmer, freediver, scuba diver, lifeguard, swimming instructor and a long distance ocean swimmer. Water is my home away from home.

You, your family, friends and community are all welcome to join us for \u201c4 Ways to Be Happy for No Reason (Yes, Even Now!)\u201d</p>", "tags": ["artsy"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": ""}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/North-Phoenix-Figure-Drawing-and-Open-Studios/events/269210197/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/North-Phoenix-Figure-Drawing-and-Open-Studios/events/269210197/", "start_time": 1587261600.0, "end_time": 1587261610.8, "location": {"latitude": "", "longitude": ""}, "name": "Open Studio Life Drawing at Thunderbird Arts Center!", "organiser": "North Phoenix Figure Drawing and Open Studios", "price": 10.0, "is_online": false, "summary": "", "description_html": "<p>Every third saturday to draw or paint from a live figure model at Thunderbird Arts Center!

It\u2019s also an official International Dark Sky Community\u2014the first and only one in California\u2014dedicated to protecting the night sky from light pollution. Backyard stargazing parties happen almost every night. Then there\u2019s the ruby red grapefruit season, which begins in late December and ends when all the grapefruit are eaten. Some local fruit stands are run on the honor system: pick up a bag and place your money in the box.</p> <p>The downtown area has a passel of ice cream shops, restaurants, and lodgings, but the local art scene evokes the most community pride. First, there are the supersize prehistoric and fantastical beasts that both line area roads and are sometimes seemingly dropped randomly in the middle of nowhere, far from any road or foot traffic. Insider tip: A map with the GPS locations of all the sculptures is available at the Anza-Borrego Desert Natural History Association desert store, which is one block west of downtown\u2019s Christmas Circle. The meticulously crafted metal creatures, rust-colored and featuring such details as curling eyelashes and \u201cfur\u201d of shaved iron, are the work of metal sculptor Ricardo Breceda. Then there are galleries with more works by local artists, the Plein Air Invitational painting event and the Circle of Art Show, both in spring.

Movement is both the medicine and the metaphor, reaching across all languages, cultures and age groups to transform suffering into art, art into awareness, and awareness into action. Where the 5Rhythms are practiced, a community is born to dance, to sweat, to change, to support, and to provide a safe place for each of us to shatter the ego's hold and awaken the juicy, unpredictable, fascinating, edge-walking, rock star part of ourselves that yearns to be free.<br/>Late Arrivals: Door on 24th Street will be locked 10:40am Sunday. Entrance to back door is through parking lot.</p> <p>What happens in Sunday Sweat Your Prayers?</p> <p>Sweat Your Prayers is minimally guided deep dive, a musical journey into the wisdom of your unique body, tender heart and intuitive mind. Free form dance traverses the territory of our searching soul, our wild and untamed spirit. And, in the same moments, connects us with other spirits, indeed, unites us with all life. 5Rhythms is a moving meditation, profound medicine and a map into this \u201cunexplored wilderness\u201d. Each rhythm \u2013 flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical, stillness \u2013 is a gateway map to deep healing.</p> <p>\u201cMaps are only maps; it\u2019s up to you to take the journey\u201d</p> <p>~ Gabrielle Roth</p> <p>So come! Every one is welcome, this is a come-as-you-are party, a safe place to express whatever truth emerges.\u2026all ages, all fitness levels, all shapes and sizes. There are no steps to learn, no possible way to get it wrong. Just bring your beautiful body and willingness to move. Every journey starts with the first step. Why not dance it?</p> <p>Each session held in meditative silence by Bella or a visiting 5Rhythms instructor.

Vivek Kaul will explain.</p> <p>He shall also address questions on personal finance from the audience.</p> <p>**VIVEK KAUL**<br/>Vivek Kaul is one of India\u2019s foremost and the most popular commentators on economics and finance. He is renowned to explain highly complex things in simple, easy-to-understand terms.</p> <p>Vivek Kaul has worked at senior positions with the Daily News and Analysis (DNA) and The Economic Times, in the past. He is a commentator on the Indian economy and currently his writing appears regularly in the Mint, BBC, Dainik Jagran, Newslaundry and Bangalore Mirror.</p> <p>He is also the author of five books. His fifth book Bad Money\u2014Inside the NPA Mess and How It Threatens the Indian Banking System, was scheduled to be published on April 13, 2020. The release has been postponed due to the lockdown to prevent spread of the corona virus disease.</p> <p>India\u2019s Big Government\u2014The Intrusive State and How It Is Hurting Us, his fourth book, was published in January 2017.</p> <p>He is also the author of the Easy Money trilogy, a series of three books on the history of money and banking, and how that caused the financial crisis that started in 2008 and is still on.

[We] would take the liberty of placing him in the same league as a Niall Ferguson or a Peter Bernstein, even though this is Vivek Kaul's first book.\u201d</p> <p>Al Ries, globally respected author and marketing consultant had this to say about Easy Money: \u201cForget what you think you know about money and read the true, absorbing tale told by Vivek. Kaul in his thorough, but fascinating book, Easy Money. A great read.\u201d</p> <p>Other than this, he has appeared as an expert on the BBC, Mirror Now, CNBC Awaaz and NDTV India.

I do my best to step aside and allow them to use my knowledge and senses to express their messages to you.</p> <p>.........................................</p> <p>REAL GOOGLE REVIEWS:</p> <p>I can confidently say that I will definitely be going back to her!

From catwalks to advertising campaigns, brands in days past have typically veered towards models of a typical build, age, and ethnicity \u2013 but we all know the world is a much richer tapestry. However, in recent years, the industry has been doing more to champion diversity, and we are seeing a much more inclusive approach to representation.</p> <p>In the previous AFA Fashion Talk we discussed about how Covid-19 will influence Fashion Digital Marketing. During this new online Meetup, we will explore Diversity and Inclusion in Fashion through four talks. As usual, we will start with the presentations by senior students of their academic researches and we will end with the talk by an expert.</p> <p>1. \"The influences of Fashion Trends on Gender Roles\", by Sabrina Marinus, 3rd-year student of the BA (Hons) Fashion with Textiles Design.</p> <p>2. \"Cultural Appropriation and Fashion\", by Gabriella Frempong, 3rd-year student of the BA (Hons) Fashion with Textiles Design.</p> <p>3. \"Gender Neutral Fashion, Is There a Future?\", by Quirine Galavazi, 3rd-year student of the BA (Hons) Fashion with Textiles Design.</p> <p>4. \"Perspectives on Diversities and Inclusions in the Fashion Industry\", by Giancarlo Pazzanese, lecturer of the Amsterdam Fashion Academy.</p> <p>At the end of the four talks, you will have the opportunity to ask questions to the panelists.</p> <p>Please, click on the link to register: <a href=\"https://luiss.webex.com/luiss/onstage/g.php?MTID=e017282e03b498828e710cbb1cc96c5ba\" class=\"linkified\">https://luiss.webex.com/luiss/onstage/g.php?MTID=e017282e03b498828e710cbb1cc96c5ba</a></p> <p>This Online Meetup has no costs.

I did start a sleeveless blouse with a different stash fabric (nothing to do with the velvet project just because I got the sudden urge). And I started a toile out of a newly bought and very cheap black jersey so I can evaluate the Lekala pattern I was going to use for my precious velvet. I also used a grey jersey fabric from my stash for a simple raglan sleeved top and now wonder if that mightn't be the best pattern for the velvet?</p> <p>Every practical bit that I get to do teaches me what works and what doesn't. Unfortunately I often stop at the stage of \"oh crikey I've run into a problem\" and never picked the project back up. That gets very frustrating.

Log in to skype and navigate to the Fresh Air Fitness group (left hand side of your Skype home screen) at 8:25am and be ready to answer/join the video call that Kelly will initiate.<br/>5. During the video workout, you can have yourself unmuted (if you wish) during the warm up and during any rest periods. But during the actual workout periods you need to mute your microphone to improve everyone's audio experience.</p> <p>Coffee Instructions:<br/>1. Kelly will host the call from 9:15am until 10:15am (possibly later! but at least until then). To help improve the experience for everyone and make things more engaging, plan to hang with us for roughly 30mins and feel free to stagger when you join/call in at any time during the hour so hopefully make for slightly smaller groups at any given time.<br/>2. You must wear headphones for the coffee chat to help reduce feedback (exception: if you have more than 1 person in your household who is joining the call together).<br/>3. We will be publishing a conversation starter for each coffee chat! This doesn't mean we can't talk about other things, or that covid-talk is off limits, but rather just gives us all something specific to contribute to the conversation. Be sure to check the top of each workout (or our Facebook reminder) for this week's coffee conversation starter.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>*Keep up to date with our virtual versus in person decision making and other updates by making sure to allow organizer emails via MeetUp.*</p>", "tags": ["sporty"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": ""}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/Catch-Me-At-Claddagh-Running-Race-Walking-Meetup/events/269870096/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/Catch-Me-At-Claddagh-Running-Race-Walking-Meetup/events/269870096/", "start_time": 1587304800.0, "end_time": 1587310200.0, "location": {"latitude": 45.098045, "longitude": -93.44167}, "name": "Catch Me At Claddagh (CMAC) Irish Pub 9 AM Sundays to Run/Walk", "organiser": "Catch Me At Claddagh - Running & Race Walking Meetup", "price": 0, "is_online": false, "summary": "", "description_html": "<p>Charities Challenge \"Catch Me At Claddagh\" open small group Training Times gathers Sunday mornings @ 9 AM in the parking lot behind The Claddagh Irish Pub &amp; Restaurant - Maple Grove.</p> <p>Temporarily limiting RSVPs to 10.</p> <p>So, please do not RSVP if you're not truly going to show up to run or walk with our happy-hearty-healthy group.</p> <p>Note: Claddagh was closed to the public as of St Patrick's Day, March 17, consistent with the Coronavirus orders of the State of MN and will reopen within several weeks when those orders are updated<br/><a href=\"http://www.claddaghirishpubs.com/maple-grove/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.claddaghirishpubs.com/maple-grove/</a></p> <p>Optional marked certified distances for training include: mile, two miles, 5k to run or race walk on our USATF certified course.

The clergy grew proud. Then they grew lax and lazy. Then the tower was overrun by the forces of evil, who took the decadent priesthood by surprise. The deity brought her wrath down upon the invaders, and the tower has been sealed for centuries. The clerics of the Sun Goddess have received visions and omens about the spire. It has been foretold that the faithful may reclaim their lost holy site\u2014if the right representatives are sent to pass tests within the tower and cleanse any remaining taint of evil that may lie within the place.</p> <p>PLAYING ONLINE, HOW IT WORKS!</p> <p>We are using our sister meetup, the RPG Alliance's accounts on Roll20 and DISCORD, both are FREE to use.</p> <p>1) Sign up for a FREE account and then Log into Roll20 (link below), JOIN the game, and once you are IN the game I can assign you a character sheet and you can input your basic data to ease dice rolling.

That way we will all have the opportunity to try something that we would like to.</p> <p>So during our virtual meetup, we would need to make the following decisions:<br/>- Size of our project<br/>- Technique(s) we will use to create our project<br/>- Where is should be donated to<br/>- When / how we will finish the project</p> <p>There are some ideas here (and many more options out there):</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.alicecaroline.com/quilt-sos/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.alicecaroline.com/quilt-sos/</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.crafterscompanion.co.uk/page/quilt4kindness/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.crafterscompanion.co.uk/page/quilt4kindness/</a></p> <p>Please join the meetup if you are interested!

Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group.</p> <p>Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him. As he says, a happy forest is a healthy forest, and he believes that eco-friendly practices not only are economically sustainable but also benefit the health of our planet and the mental and physical health of all who live on Earth.</p>", "tags": ["geeky", "family-friendly"], "price_tier": 0, "rating": 0, "image": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/3/6/e/highres_487721838.jpeg"}, {"event_id": "MEETUP-https://www.meetup.com/Ferrante-Fever-An-Elena-Ferrante-Reading-Group/events/270009922/", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/Ferrante-Fever-An-Elena-Ferrante-Reading-Group/events/270009922/", "start_time": 1587306600.0, "end_time": 1587313800.0, "location": {"latitude": -8.521147, "longitude": 179.1962}, "name": "L'Amore Molesto / Troubling Love: Discussion", "organiser": "Ferrante Fever: An Elena Ferrante Reading Group", "price": 0, "is_online": true, "summary": "", "description_html": "<p>The next meeting of Ferrante Fever will be a discussion on Elena Ferrante's 1992 book, 'Troubling Love' or 'L'Amore Molesto.'
